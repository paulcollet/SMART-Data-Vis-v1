Changes:

    1. Added ability to show or not show a class (This uses the dropdown list the class colors was already using)
    2. You now have to choose a graph before one shows up
    3. The number of linked graphs in the STS-SPC will now reset when loading a new graph
    4. Minor UI and code adjustments

Personal Goals:

    1. A reset button if separated graphs were moved
    2. Mouse controls in general
    3. See what can be paralleized
    4. Set up the program so Windows can't scale buttons

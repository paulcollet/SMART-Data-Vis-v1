Changes:

1. Added ability to show or not show a class (This uses the dropdown list the class colors was already using)
2. You now have to choose a graph before one shows up
3. The number of linked graphs in the STS-SPC will now reset when loading a new graph
4. Minor UI and code adjustments

Personal Goals:

1. A reset button if separated graphs were moved
2. Mouse controls in general

Personal Note: OpenMP/threading is problematic as openGL is not thread safe and the vector class is being used sequentially (i.e. vectorname.puck_back(x)).
